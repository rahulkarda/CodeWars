## Optimizations:

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve. Getting better with time is the journey I am following.
